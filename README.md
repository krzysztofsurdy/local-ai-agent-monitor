<p align="center">
A Next.js web dashboard to monitor and visualize all AI coding agent activity on your local machine. Acts as a single pane of glass for everything Claude Code (and other AI CLI tools) are doing — processes, agent teams, tasks, conversations, skills, MCP servers, configuration, debug logs, and session history.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Claude Code installed (data lives in `~/.claude/`)

### Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name barko \
  --pid=host \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v ~/.claude:/home/nextjs/.claude:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ydrus/barko:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

- `--pid=host` lets Barko see host processes for the Processes page
- The volume mount is read-only -- Barko never writes to `~/.claude/`

**Note:** On macOS, Docker runs inside a Linux VM so `--pid=host` only exposes the VM's processes, not the macOS host's. The Processes page will be empty. All other features (teams, tasks, conversations, skills, agents, config, logs, history) work normally. On Linux, process monitoring works as expected.
